# READY

We access Redis without authentication, escalate privileges and generate SSH keys to gain root access. We download a zip file, break its password and extract the root flag.

## Recognition phase

The following command was executed to launch an ICMP trace to the ip to confirm that there was a connection to the target machine.

```ping -c 1 192.168.1.16 ```

Here the connection is confirmed with one packet transmitted and one packet received. In addition, the ttl(time to live) information is obtained, which is 63, characteristic of a host running Linux as operating system. 

Now we proceed with the nmap scan to find out which services are running on which ports and also the version of these services, so we scan the whole range of ports and launch basic nmap recon scripts.

```nmap -sVC -n -Pn --open -p- 192.168.1.1```

A service called Redis is located on port 6379.

The following command was executed in order to obtain more information about Redis.

```redis-cli -h ```

<br><img src="..\assets\img\commons\Ready\RedisInformation.png" alt="ReadyRecon2" style="max-width: 600px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"><br>

It is discovered that we can connect to this service.

Therefore the following command is executed:

```redis-cli -h 192.168.1.16```

this allows us to log in to the service without any kind of password.

## Privilege escalation in Redis

Reading on hacktricks about the Redis service we discover [the following article](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/6379-pentesting-redis) that allows us to abuse the Redis configuration.

With the following command we obtain the path to the root directory of the system.

```config get dir```

We are going to follow the steps found in hacktricks to generate a public and private key pair and get ssh access to the server.

Once we are done we can connect to the Redis server with the private key.

```ssh -i id_rsa root@192.168.1.16```

<br><img src="..\assets\img\commons\Ready\Escalation3.png" alt="ReadyRecon2" style="max-width: 600px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"><br>

Once inside we see a root.zip file

<br><img src="..\assets\img\commons\Ready\Escalation4.png" alt="ReadyRecon2" style="max-width: 600px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"><br>

On the target machine a web server with python was mounted on port 443.

```python3 -m http.server 443```

Then on our machine we used the wget utility to be able to get the root.zip

```wget http://192.168.1.16:443/root.zip```

Here we apply brute force to root.zip using the hashes extracted from it.

```php zip2john root.zip > hash.txt```

```john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt ```

Finally we extract the contents of the root.zip folder with unzip using the password provided by john.

```unzip root.zip```

We see the root flag, having successfully compromised the machine.
