Welcome to my website! Here is a little bit about me.

## Background

My name is Ezequiel, and I have been passionate about technology since I was a child. When I got my first computer, I couldn't get enough of it and wanted to understand how everything worked inside. I always looked for ways to automate things to make them more efficient.

Recently, I have developed a strong interest in the world of cybersecurity, especially in the offensive area. I enjoy learning about vulnerabilities, ethical hacking techniques, and how to protect systems from potential threats.

## Website Scope

On this website, I will publish write-ups of machines from different platforms like Vulnyx and Hack The Box. I will also post reviews of certifications such as the eJPTv2, which I am currently studying for. Additionally, I will share various interesting topics related to cybersecurity that I come across.
